## Requirements
Create a mobile app that simulates a traffic light.
* The app needs 2 screens. 
    * A screen for the stop light with a button to restart the cycle and
    * A screen to show the history of light changes (event name and timestamp) and restart button presses.
example:  
    * Restart Pressed                       Tue, 28 Jun 2022 16:52:04 EST
    * Light Changed - Yellow           Tue, 28 Jun 2022 16:55:04 EST

* The traffic light (from top to bottom) has a red, yellow, and green light. 
* The traffic light should continuously cycle through the different lights in the following order & duration:
    1. Green for 5 seconds
    2. Yellow for 2 seconds
    3. Red for 4 seconds
* Implement a simple database solution to support storing the history records.
* The ‚ÄúRestart‚Äù button should stop/interrupt the current cycle and reset the traffic light, starting over.

* Bonus (not required)
    * Add unit tests üòâ
